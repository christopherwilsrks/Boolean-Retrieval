The Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi says a big military operation is under way to rest control of the city of Fallujah from Islamic State fighters who seized it more than two years ago. Thousands of troops have mustered around the city 50 kilometers west of Baghdad in recent day. Demir has more of the operation. The built-up has been going on for quite a while, but as far as we know not much of that actually happened in terms of offensive presumed they will do some kind of softening-out bombardment. It's been a toss-up really between going for Fallujah or Mosul, the big prize of being in the north second city, but certainly the Iraqi seemed to decide Fallujah had to be dealt with first. It's right on the door to Baghdad over to the west. So that's what they're doing whether the Americans hold halt to behind it. They said nothing yet. They don't tend to believe in announcing offenses until they are actually under way cuz the element of surprise of course is totally gone.

Hundreds of thousands of postal votes will determine today who's won the neck and neck race to become Austria's next president. Results from Sunday's voting at polling stations left the outcome too close to call. Norbert Hofer, the candidate of the far-right anti-migrant and Euro skeptic freedom party is pitted against the former Green party leader Alexander Van der Bellen. Bethany Belle is following developments in Vienna. Projected results see the results will be very very close still, even when those postal votes are taken into consideration, it could still be almost 50-50 for both of them. Possibly with a slight advantage to Alexander Van der Bellen but as I say so close that is really impossible to tell at the moment. We also saw just quite interesting in the breakdown of the vote lots of support for Alexander Van der Bellen of the Green in big cities, but lots of support for Norbert Hofer in the countryside. World news from the BBC.
