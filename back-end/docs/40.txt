Donald Trump has begun his term as the 45th president of the United States with a pledge to end, what he called, the carnage of America. In his inaugural address, he promised change to end the scourges of abandoned factories, rampant crime and a failed education system. In foreign policy, he pledged to build new alliances and to unite the civilized world with the aim of completely eradicating radical Islamic terrorism.
Mr. Trump moved quickly to sign his first executive order as president including the proclamation of a national day of patriotism. He also signed a waiver to allow James Mattis to serve as defense secretary even though it's less than the required seven years since he left the military.
There've been protests in a number of cities across the United States as Mr. Trump sworn in. In Washington, police used pepper spray and stun grenades against protesters, some of whom damaged vehicles and destroyed property. There were more than 200 arrests.
