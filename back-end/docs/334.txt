Finance Ministers of Eurozone countries are meeting on Monday to discuss the payout. Yogita Limaye reports from Athens. All 153 MPs of the ruling Syriza Party voted in favor of new austerity measures. That'll passed by Greece's 300-member parliament. They include economic reforms that will see people paying more taxes and pensions being cut.

The Philippines is holding a presidential election in which the established political order could be overturned by a little known local mayor. Rodrigo Duterte's brash campaign has galvanized voters. Jonathan Head reports from outside a polling station in Manila. This has been a very hard-fought presidential campaign.

With quite a lot of controversial policy platforms, things like federalism, for example, let alone, an incredibly tough attitude to crime. He surged into the lead, and that's given a real freesome to contest with the other four presidential candidates with some of them, in the last stages, even suggesting they should form an alliance, although it has not yet happened to try and block Mayor Duterte.
The South Korean government has dismissed as propaganda suggestions made by the North that the two countries should meet for talks. Steve Evans reports from Pyongyang. North Korea's supreme leader, as he's called, said that representatives from Seoul and Pyongyang should meet to find ways of easing the tension along the highly militarized border. South Korea's Unification Ministry responded that the suggestion was merely a propaganda drive with no sincerity. The pattern of relations between South and North over recent years is for tensions to ratchet up and then be eased as both sides tone down their rhetoric only for the process to be repeated.
