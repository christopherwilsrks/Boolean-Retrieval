The Russian Olympic Committe says that most of the team will be allowed to take part in the Rio games. It confirmed that 271 have been cleared to compete, with five more waiting for final decision. Alex Capstick reports from Rio. The last-minute vetting process of Russian athletes followed stunning revelations that the state-operated doping program for many years across mang sports. The country's track and field team was barred from the Olympics. But the IOC decided aganist a blanket banï¼Œsaying it was unfair on those who had never committed drug violations. Instead, individual federations will be given the task of judging Russian competitors. Only a few of those governing bodies have followed the tougher approach adopted by the IAAF which runs international athletics. Earlier, the head of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach declared the drug cheats of the Rio Olympics would have no place to hide.
The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, has strongly denied that a 400-million-dollar payment to Iran was a ransom for the release of American prisoners. He said it was paid to settle a decades-old dispute over a failed military equipment deal. The cash transfer coincided with the signing of a nuclear agreement with Iran, and prisoners swapped in which 4 Americans were released. Republicans including the presidential candidate, Donald Trump, have been attacking the administration over the timing of the transfer.
President Obama has confirmed that both presidential candidates will be given security briefings to prepare them for office if they won but warned that these were classified. Mr Obama has previously described the Republican candidate Donald Trump as unfit to be president. Mr Obama also dismissed claims by Donald Trump that the US presidential election could be rigged. The federal government doesn't run the election process. If Mr Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country. That is ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense, and I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
Military scientists in the United States say they have carried out tests showing that experimental vaccines can protect monkeys from the Zika virus. More details from Jane Dripper. This research is based in Massachusetts and Maryland, published results five weeks ago, establishing their potential vaccines could ward off the virus in mice. And now they've shown the same success in 20 monkeys. They tested three types of vaccine, two using genes from Zika and one which was an inactive replica of the virus. All three stimulated the immune system and gave full protection. The next step would be early trials possibly late this year to establish that the vaccine is safe and effective in humans. BBC news.
