She's rejected claims that she manipulated budget figures to help secure her re-election in 2014. Brian Winter, the-editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly Magazine says there's been something about backlash against what took place in the lower house. A lot of people likened it to a circus. You had people shooting off confetti and screaming and you know dedicating their votes to god and family and peace in Palestine and also to causes that kind of make Brazilians or some Brazilians look at this whole process and raise their eyebrows and go 'Gosh, are we really sure we want to do this?' The senate is expected to open an impeachment trial next month and suspend the president while the proceedings take place.

A replica of the 2000-year-old Arch of Triumphal destroyed by the IS group in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra last year will be unveiled in London today. Naomi Grimley reports. This is the sound of a computer-controlled drill chiseling away at blocks of marble. The machine was programmed with 3D images of the original 2000-year-old arch so the texture of the stone could be replicated. It's a collaboration between experts from Oxford and Harvard Universities and Dubai's Museum of the Future. The group hope technology like this might help rebuild parts of Palmyra. But some classic scholars think the replica arch is a waste of time and money.
New research shall suggest that dinosaurs were on their way to extinction millions of years before meteor impact which is widely believed to have wiped them out. Dr Chris Venditti is one of the authors of the new research. He says dinosaurs began to lose their supremacy in the evolutionary chain. There was some competition for resources and these dinosaurs weren't winning. They weren't able to survive in their environment anymore and thus went extinct. And the opportunity didn't seem to be there for other species to lead to new species themselves. So again, the combination of those two things led to the decline.BBC news.
