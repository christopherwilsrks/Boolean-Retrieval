Campaigning to the EU referendum in Britain has been suspended after a member of parliament was killed in an attack in Northern England. The Labor MP Jo Cox was shot and stabbed outside the library where she was meeting her constituencies in West Yorkshire. She's the first serving British MP to be murdered in 25 years. A 52-year-old man has been arrested. An eyewitness Clarke Rothwell said he shouted 'Britain First' during the attack. Our political correspondent Rob Watson have this to say about the possible motivation. I think there's still considerable confusion because despite that eyewitness's accounts that happen, other eyewitness'accounts which in a way muddy the waters whether she absolutely definitely was clearly the intended target of her attacker. So I just think, given one's experience of covering these sources of event, one has to be incredibly, incredibly careful to draw conclusions.
President Obama has challenged the Republican-controlled congress to rise to the moment on pass gun control legislation. After meeting relatives of those killed in the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando on Sunday, Mr. Obama said U.S. politics have conspired to make it easy for a terrorist or a disturbed person to buy powerful weapons. I am pleased to hear that the senate will hold votes on preventing individuals who were possible terrorist ties from buying guns, including assault weapons. I truly hope the senators rise to the moment and do the right thing. I hope the senators who voted no on background checks after Newtown have a change of heart. And then I hope the House does the right thing and helps to end the plague of violence that these weapons inflict on so many lives.
